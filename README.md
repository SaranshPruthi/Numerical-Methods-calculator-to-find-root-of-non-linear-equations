# Numerical-Methods-calculator-to-find-root-of-non-linear-equations
This calculator can solve root finding problem of non-linear equations using six different optimized algorithms, namely, Bisection method ; False Position method ; Fixed Point Iteration method ; Newton's method ; Secant method ;  Modified Newton's method

This calculator is made in MATLAB and 6 different files (each for one algorithm) has been uploaded in the repository and root finding problem of non-linear equations can be solved by each of the six algorithms with the desried level of accuracy as specified by the user
